# Drawing with Canvas

[Demo project](https://test-assignment-canvas.surge.sh/).

## Functions

- Allow adding lines by two clicks (first click creates the first position; then user moves the mouse and the line should be visible.
- If the user clicks left mouse button again the line should be added to image.
- If user starts drawing and presses right mouse button, donâ€™t the line.
- If a line intersects, show red dot (independent of line status - creating or added).
- When the user clicks "collapse lines", the lines should be collapsed to the center of the line as a 3 second animation.
